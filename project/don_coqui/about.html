				<h3>About Us</h3>
				<div class="left_about float-left" id="border">
					<p>
					Don Coqui is the most exciting Authentic Puerto 
					Rican dining in all of the Tri-State area; owned and 
					operated by third generation restaurateurs Jaleene 
					and Jewelle Rodriguez, daughters of renowned 
					restaurateur Jimmy Rodriguez, pioneer of the “Puerto
					Rican dinning-entertainment” experience in New York.
					These two young entrepreneurial Latinas have spent 
					their entire life in a family run business. Their 
					childhood memories of the restaurants include the.

					company of Tito Puente, Marc Anthony, Luis Guzman, 
					Celia Cruz, Bill Clinton, Derek Jeter, Congressman Serrano
					David Bowie and Fat Joe to name a few. They describe
					Don Coqui to feel like “home”. Their grandfather Jimmy
					Rodriguez Sr. started selling fish in the south Bronx; 
					their father Jimmy Rodriguez Jr. owned numerous
					restaurants in New York including Jimmy's Bronx Café,
					Jimmy’s Uptown, Jimmy’s Downtown and Jimmy’s City
					Island.

					These two ladies have inherited passion and affection for the business passed down from one Don to another. “Our late grandfather often spoke of keeping it simple and authentic. His work ethic remains unmatched. Our father has worked for years to change the restaurant game against many odds. Puerto Rican cuisine was once only available in ‘Cuchifritos’. Now, people come from near and far to enjoy the core of our culture, la comida! We couldn’t be more excited to continue our family’s tradition of turning ordinary dinners into extraordinary experiences. Being a part of that is very special,” says Jewelle Rodriguez. Don Coqui is a family labor of love that brings the Rodriguez family’s passion for food and entertaining to new heights.
