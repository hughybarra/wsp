				<h2>SITE INTENT</h2>

				<p> 
					The goal for your company running a website is to increase customer awareness and potentially bring in more customers via the website. In order to increase website traffic current industry standards must be met and that’s where HyWeb comes in. HyWeb’s objective with this project is to redesign the Doncoqui website to bring it within current industry web standards, re-organizing information into a well structured and well formatted manner, create a global navigation that is easy to use, increase the amount of web traffic the restaurant receives, and possibly convert those web surfers into restaurant customers. 
				</p>

				<h2>Target Market</h2>
				<p>
					The average age of your online customers range between 25-34 years, are mostly males, with some college, or have graduated form college, do not have children, and browse your website from work. The key information here is that most of your site surfers view your page while at work. Maybe planning lunch, and or dinner plans. Implementing lunch and dinner specials on the website might be a great way to target and get these users into your restaurant.
