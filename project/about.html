				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>Don Coqui is the most exciting Authentic Puerto Rican dining in all of the Tri-State area; owned and operated by third generation restaurateurs Jaleene and Jewelle Rodriguez, daughters of renowned restaurateur Jimmy Rodriguez, pioneer of the “Puerto Rican dinning-entertainment” experience in New York.</p>

				<p>These two young entrepreneurial Latinas have spent their entire life in a family run business. Their childhood memories of the restaurants include the company of Tito Puente, Marc Anthony, Luis Guzman, Celia Cruz, Bill Clinton, Derek Jeter, Congressman Serrano, David Bowie and Fat Joe to name a few. They describe Don Coqui to feel like “home”. Their grandfather Jimmy Rodriguez Sr. started selling fish in the south Bronx; their father Jimmy Rodriguez Jr. owned numerous restaurants in New York including Jimmy's Bronx Café, Jimmy’s Uptown, Jimmy’s Downtown and Jimmy’s City Island.</p>

				<p>These two ladies have inherited passion and affection for the business passed down from one Don to another. “Our late grandfather often spoke of keeping it simple and authentic. His work ethic remains unmatched. Our father has worked for years to change the restaurant game against many odds. Puerto Rican cuisine was once only available in ‘Cuchifritos’. Now, people come from near and far to enjoy the core of our culture, la comida! We couldn’t be more excited to continue our family’s tradition of turning ordinary dinners into extraordinary experiences. Being a part of that is very special,” says Jewelle Rodriguez. Don Coqui is a family labor of love that brings the Rodriguez family’s passion for food and entertaining to new heights.<p>

				<p>Don Coqui’s main dining room, located on the second floor of the restaurant, showcases the Rodriguez signature style, evident throughout the menu with house specialties including the ever-popular empanadas, paella, and arroz con pollo, alongside classic American staples such as</p>

				<p>he Porterhouse for two, baked clams and barbecue ribs, among many other culinary delights.</p>

				<p>The vast first floor is a gourmand’s dream and is the perfect place to host any event. It features a professional kitchen, an interactive demonstration kitchen with a granite eat-on counter for 20, and an additional room with kitchen space suitable for presentations and in-room cooking. The interactive kitchen and party space provides the perfect venue for any celebration or recreational event such as:<p>
